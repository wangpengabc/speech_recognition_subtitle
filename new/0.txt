We're just 16.
I simply didn't have the answer.
But I shouldn't get back home anymore.
Now I have to admit my father isn't a bad guy.
It was similar to my childhood allergy.
I couldn't believe how well my plan had worked.
We don't have heating.
I wasn't ready yet.
We get in touch every evening.
The island was perfect for me.
It was a mystery to me.
And I don't know how long we'll be together.
My mom is still quite young.
I was very surprised.
She refused to work for free.
And they let me go.
I started to fall ill a little more often.
And I'm not talking about my new friends.
She hasn't even turned 50 yet.
Still I decided not to jump into action just yet.
I like spending time with him I didn't want to be around him all the time.
My hands were really shaking when I took the letter and opened it.
I was already 18.
But I won't let him go anyway.
I thought it was some workers washing the windows.
Suddenly an idea came to me.
Here is much better than anywhere else.
I got incredibly upset.
Do you believe in magic.
Conscience wouldn't let me do it.
I was not happy.
My fingers turn black in front of my eyes.
Well.
Well I crawled out of my bed.
But no one understood the reason for such sharp climatic changes.
Little by little he's going back to normal.
My plan worked like a charm.
Temperature became normal.
I'd say he looks like a Greek god.
He knew someone who could get me exactly what I needed.
I don't know what happens now.
It was sad.
I knew that the process would be long but I was ready to wait.
I felt very well here.
There was a note.
Where is.
Everything was fine.
Every time she told me what to do I just close the door to my room and ignored her.
I found a local boyfriend.
My friends know about my hobby.
No notice anything special about me.
